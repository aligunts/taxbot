# Legacy Test Files

These files have been moved from the project root to this directory to reduce clutter. They contain test implementations that were used during development but are not required for the production application.

## Files

- testQueries.js - Testing various query patterns
- testExemption.js - Testing VAT exemption detection
- testVATExemptionFunction.js - Testing the VAT exemption function
- testVATExemption.js - Testing VAT exemption API calls
- testPerWordIssue.js - Testing specific word parsing issues
- extractionTest.js - Testing value extraction from queries

## Note

These files are kept for reference purposes. If you need to revisit the original test implementations, you can find them here. They may contain redundant or outdated code but are preserved for historical purposes.
