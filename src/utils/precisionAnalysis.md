# VAT Calculation Precision Analysis

## Summary of Findings

After conducting detailed precision tests on our VAT calculation system, we've confirmed that our implementation correctly handles VAT calculations with high precision. The key findings are:

### Price Before VAT (PBV) from VAT-inclusive Amount

For a VAT-inclusive price of ₦10,000:

- Correct PBV: ₦9,302.33 (rounded to 2 decimal places)
- VAT Amount: ₦697.67
- Total: ₦10,000.00

This confirms that our implementation follows the correct formula:

```
PBV = TP / (1 + VAT Rate)
PBV = 10,000 / 1.075 = 9,302.325581... ≈ 9,302.33
```

### VAT Amount from VAT-exclusive Amount

For a VAT-exclusive price of ₦10,000:

- Base Amount: ₦10,000.00
- VAT Amount: ₦750.00
- Total: ₦10,750.00

This confirms correct handling of the formula:

```
VAT Amount = Base Amount * VAT Rate
VAT Amount = 10,000 * 0.075 = 750.00
```

## Implementation Details

Our current implementation:

1. Uses Decimal.js for high-precision calculations to avoid floating-point errors
2. Maintains full precision throughout intermediate calculations
3. Only rounds to 2 decimal places in the final output
4. Correctly handles both VAT-inclusive and VAT-exclusive amounts

## Notable Observations

1. **High Internal Precision**: All calculations maintain high internal precision (set to 20+ digits) to ensure accuracy during intermediate steps.

2. **Verification Checks**: Our precision test implements multiple cross-verification methods that all confirm the mathematical consistency of our results:

   - Base + VAT = Total
   - VAT = Base \* VAT Rate (for VAT-exclusive calculations)
   - Base = Total / (1 + VAT Rate) (for VAT-inclusive calculations)

3. **Rounding Behavior**: The final rounding to 2 decimal places occurs only in the returned results, ensuring that businesses get standard currency-formatted values while maintaining precision internally.

## Conclusion

Our VAT calculations provide the exact results expected according to Nigerian VAT regulations. For a VAT-inclusive price of ₦10,000, the correct price before VAT is ₦9,302.33, which our system now accurately calculates and returns.
