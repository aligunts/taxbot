# VAT Exemption Logic Improvements

## Key Improvements

1. **Fixed "per" Keyword Issue**: Added "per" to stopwords list and implemented word boundary checks to prevent false matches of "per" as a baby product.

2. **Enhanced Matching Logic**:

   - Added strict word boundary checks for short keywords
   - Improved contextual matching for multi-word phrases
   - Special case handling for export services

3. **Better Item Extraction**:

   - Added support for plural forms through stemming
   - Improved extraction of multi-word combinations
   - Better detection of quantity + item patterns (e.g., "5kg rice")

4. **More Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Created test scripts to verify VAT exemption logic
   - Added specific tests for problematic cases
   - Improved error handling and diagnostics

## Results

- "per" in phrases like "per person" no longer triggers false exemption
- Actual exempt items like diapers, baby formula, tomatoes are correctly identified
- Better handling of export services and goods
- Plural forms are correctly matched to their singular forms

The changes ensure more accurate VAT exemption detection and prevent false positives, improving the overall user experience with the Taxbot chatbot.
