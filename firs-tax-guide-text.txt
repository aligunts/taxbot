Taxes Administered by the Federal Inland Revenue Service in 
Nigeria 
Executive Summary 
The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) stands as the principal tax administrator for 
the Federal Government of Nigeria, overseeing a diverse array of taxes that form the 
bedrock of national revenue generation. This report provides a comprehensive 
analysis of the taxes under the FIRS's jurisdiction, detailing their tax bases, applicable 
rates, legislative frameworks, and the purpose and allocation of the generated 
revenue. Recent changes and updates in the Nigerian tax landscape, particularly 
those affecting FIRS-administered taxes, are also explored. Furthermore, the report 
outlines the process for obtaining a Tax Identification Number (TIN) from the FIRS, 
investigates the role and functions of the FIRS in tax administration and enforcement, 
and highlights the official resources available to taxpayers for navigating the Nigerian 
federal tax system. Understanding these aspects is crucial for businesses, investors, 
and researchers seeking to operate within or analyze the Nigerian economic 
environment. 
Introduction to the Nigerian Federal Tax System 
Taxation in Nigeria is structured across three tiers of government, each with specific 
responsibilities for revenue collection.
1
 This decentralized system includes the Federal 
Government, State Governments, and Local Governments, as enshrined in the 1999 
Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
1
 The Constitution grants the Federal 
Government, through its exclusive legislative list, the authority to tax the income and 
profits of businesses, individuals, and corporate entities.
1 
The primary agency responsible for administering federal taxes is the Federal Inland 
Revenue Service (FIRS).
1
 Established to manage taxes due to the Federal Government, 
the FIRS plays a pivotal role in the nation's fiscal framework.
1
 In contrast, State Boards 
of Internal Revenue (SBIRs) are tasked with administering taxes owed to the 
respective State Governments. Their main responsibility lies in the administration of 
Personal Income Tax (PIT) as stipulated by the Personal Income Tax Act CAP P8 LFN 
2011 (as amended), alongside other revenue items as defined by state administrative 
laws.
1
 This delineation of responsibilities ensures that tax collection aligns with the 
jurisdictional powers of each government level. 
Local Governments, at the third tier, administer levies within their area councils, 
operating under the framework of the approved Taxes and Levies (Approved List for 

Collection) Act (LFN 1998 No.2, 1998).
1
 These levies are typically localized and address 
specific revenue needs at the grassroots level. 
The hierarchical structure of the Nigerian tax system, with its division of 
responsibilities, presents a framework for revenue generation tailored to each level of 
governance. For taxpayers, navigating this system requires a clear understanding of 
which tax authority is responsible for administering specific taxes to ensure 
compliance at the appropriate level. 
Specific Taxes Administered by the Federal Inland Revenue 
Service (FIRS) 
The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is mandated to administer a comprehensive 
range of taxes on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria.
1
 These taxes cover 
various aspects of economic activity and serve as the primary sources of federal 
revenue. The key taxes under the jurisdiction of the FIRS include: 
● 
Companies Income Tax (CIT): A tax imposed on the profits of companies 
operating within Nigeria.
1 
● 
Tertiary Education Tax (TET): A levy payable by all Nigerian companies on their 
assessable profits, with the revenue dedicated to the development of tertiary 
education in the country.
1 
● 
Stamp Duties: A tax charged on various written and electronic instruments that 
have legal effect.
1 
● 
Withholding Tax (WHT): An advance payment of income tax deducted at the 
source of certain transactions, applicable to companies, residents of the Federal 
Capital Territory (FCT), and non-resident individuals.
1 
● 
Value Added Tax (VAT): A consumption tax levied on the supply of most goods 
and services within Nigeria, as well as on imports.
1 
● 
Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT): A tax specifically targeting the profits generated 
from petroleum operations, primarily upstream activities related to oil and gas 
exploration and production.
1 
● 
Capital Gains Tax (CGT): A tax imposed on the profits realized from the sale or 
exchange of certain capital assets.
1 
● 
Pay As You Earn (PAYE): An income tax system where tax is deducted directly 
from the salaries and wages of employees who are residents of the FCT, members 
of the armed forces, the police force, and other paramilitary organizations.
1 
● 
Police Trust Fund Levy: A levy established to provide funding for the training, 
welfare, and equipment needs of the Nigeria Police Force.
1 
● 
National Information Technology Development Levy (NITDL): A levy payable 

by specified companies with an annual turnover exceeding N100 million, aimed at 
fostering the development of information technology in Nigeria.
1 
● 
Education Tax (ET): While mentioned in some contexts, this term likely refers to 
the Tertiary Education Tax (TET) due to the similarity in purpose and the absence 
of distinct details.
3 
● 
National Housing Fund (NHF): While businesses and organizations are involved 
in filing returns related to the NHF, its primary administration falls under the 
purview of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria. The FIRS's role may primarily 
involve collection for certain entities.
4 
This comprehensive list underscores the FIRS's central role in federal revenue 
mobilization, encompassing broad-based taxes on income and consumption, as well 
as sector-specific levies designed to support targeted development initiatives. The 
Nigerian federal tax system, as administered by the FIRS, employs a diverse set of 
instruments to generate revenue from various facets of the economy. 
Detailed Analysis of Major FIRS-Administered Taxes 
Companies Income Tax (CIT) 
Companies Income Tax (CIT), Nigeria's equivalent of corporate tax, is levied on the 
profits of companies operating within the country.
5
 The tax base encompasses a wide 
range of income sources, including profits from trade or business, rental income from 
properties, investment income such as premiums and interest, dividends, royalties, 
fees derived from Nigeria, and any income accruing in, derived from, or brought into 
Nigeria.
5
 For tax purposes, a company's residency is determined by its place of 
incorporation. Nigerian companies are taxed on their global income, regardless of its 
origin. In contrast, Non-Resident Companies (NRCs) are subject to CIT only on profits 
earned within Nigeria, specifically those attributable to their Nigerian operations or if 
they have established a Significant Economic Presence (SEP).
6 
The applicable CIT rate is structured based on a company's annual turnover. Small 
companies, with a turnover of less than NGN25 million, are exempt from CIT. 
Medium-sized companies, with a turnover between NGN25 million and NGN100 
million, are taxed at a rate of 20%. Large companies, with a turnover exceeding 
NGN100 million, are subject to the standard CIT rate of 30%.
6
 Taxable profit is 
calculated by aggregating all trading income and subtracting allowable expenses, 
which include costs incurred wholly, exclusively, necessarily, and reasonably for the 
purpose of generating profit. Companies can also deduct capital allowances on 
qualifying assets and carry forward tax losses.
5
 Furthermore, various tax credits, such 
as Withholding Tax Credits, Foreign Tax Credits, and sector-specific credits, can be 

claimed against the final CIT liability.
5
 To ensure a minimum contribution, a minimum 
tax may be imposed at a rate of 0.5% of turnover less franked investment income, 
applicable when a company reports a loss, has no tax payable, or the tax payable is 
below the minimum threshold. However, exemptions from minimum tax exist for new 
companies and those in certain sectors like primary agriculture.
7 
The primary legal framework governing CIT is the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA).
5
 
This Act has been amended over the years, notably through the Finance Acts of 2019, 
2020, and 2021, to reflect changes in economic realities and government policies.
9 
Company Income Tax serves as a substantial source of revenue for the Nigerian 
government.
9
 The funds generated are crucial for financing public services, 
developing infrastructure, and supporting various government initiatives aimed at 
fostering economic growth and enhancing the quality of life for citizens.
15
 CIT revenue, 
along with other federal taxes, is typically deposited into the Federation Account and 
subsequently distributed among the federal, state, and local government levels based 
on a predetermined revenue allocation formula.
16 
The tiered CIT rate structure reflects a principle of progressive taxation, where larger 
and more profitable entities contribute a greater share of their earnings to public 
revenue. The distinction in tax treatment between resident and non-resident 
companies, along with the introduction of the Significant Economic Presence (SEP) 
rule, addresses the complexities of taxing multinational corporations and businesses 
operating in the digital economy. The minimum tax provision ensures a baseline 
contribution from companies, while the availability of tax credits incentivizes 
compliance and prevents double taxation for companies already subject to 
withholding taxes or taxes in other jurisdictions.

Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT) 

Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT) is a specialized tax levied on the profits of companies 
engaged in upstream petroleum operations within Nigeria, encompassing activities 
such as exploration, production, and the initial transportation or sale of crude oil and 
natural gas.
3
 The tax base is the petroleum profit, calculated as the difference 
between a company's taxable income and allowable expenses, as defined by the 
Petroleum Profit Tax Act.
3
 For PPT assessment, revenue includes income from the sale 
of petroleum products, royalties received, interest from petroleum-related activities, 
and other income directly related to these operations.
19 
The rates for PPT vary based on the nature of the operations. For non-PSC 
operations, which include joint ventures, the tax rate is 65.75% for the first five years 
of operation under continuous production where pre-production costs have not been 
fully amortized, and 85% thereafter.
3
 For operations under production sharing 
contracts (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), a rate of 
50% applies.
9
 Additionally, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 introduced a 
hydrocarbon tax (HT) applicable to holders of Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPL) 
and Petroleum Mining Leases (PML) for onshore and shallow water operations, with 
rates of 15% and 30% respectively. Upstream gas profits are taxed at a rate of 30%.
6
 
Allowable deductions for PPT calculation include operational costs, capital allowances 
on qualifying expenditures, and royalties paid to the Nigerian government. Investment 
tax credits may also be available to incentivize specific investments within the 
petroleum sector.
18 
The primary legislation governing PPT is the Petroleum Profit Tax Act (PPTA).
3
 The 
Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 has brought about a significant overhaul of the 
fiscal and regulatory framework for the petroleum industry, introducing the 
Hydrocarbon Tax alongside modifications to the PPT regime.
10
 The Finance Act 2023 
has further clarified certain aspects of the PPTA.
23 
Given the oil and gas sector's pivotal role in Nigeria's economy, Petroleum Profit Tax is 
a major source of governmental revenue.
19
 The revenue generated from PPT is crucial 
for funding government operations across all tiers, as it is remitted into the Federation 
Account and forms a substantial portion of the national budget.
3
 The fundamental aim 
of PPT is to ensure that the Nigerian government secures a fair share of the profits 
derived from the exploitation of the nation's oil and gas reserves.
18 
The complex structure of PPT rates and regulations reflects the strategic importance 
of the petroleum industry and the government's dual objectives of maximizing 
revenue and encouraging continued investment. The introduction of the Hydrocarbon 
Tax under the PIA represents a significant evolution in the fiscal framework for this 

sector. The high tax rates, particularly for established non-PSC operations, highlight 
the government's focus on capturing a substantial portion of the economic rent from 
petroleum resources.

Value Added Tax (VAT) 
Value Added Tax (VAT) in Nigeria is a consumption tax imposed on the supply of all 
goods and services within the country, as well as on the importation of goods and 
services, except for specific exemptions outlined in the VAT Act.
3
 As a multi-stage tax, 
VAT is collected at each point in the production and distribution chain where value is 
added, but the final consumer ultimately bears the cost.
3
 The tax is calculated as a 
percentage of the value added at each stage of the supply. 
The standard VAT rate in Nigeria is 7.5%, an increase from the previous rate of 5% 
effective February 1, 2020.
3
 Certain goods and services are zero-rated, meaning VAT 
is charged at 0%, allowing businesses to claim back any VAT incurred on inputs. 

Additionally, a range of items are exempt from VAT, including basic food items, 
medical products and services, pharmaceutical products, books, and educational 
materials.
27
 For compliance, VAT invoices must contain specific details such as the 
names, addresses, and Tax Identification Numbers of both the supplier and the 
customer, a unique VAT invoice number, the date of supply, a description of the goods 
or services provided, the VAT rate, the amount of VAT charged, and the total gross 
amount.
34
 Registered businesses are required to file VAT returns with the Federal 
Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on a monthly basis, by the 21st day of the month 
following the month of the transaction.
9 
The primary legislation governing VAT in Nigeria is the VAT Act LFN 2004 as 
amended.
3
 The Finance Acts from 2019 to 2023, along with the Value Added Tax 
(Modification) Order of 2021, have introduced significant amendments to the VAT Act, 
outlining the scope, exemptions, and administrative procedures for VAT.
29 
Value Added Tax is a critical source of non-oil revenue for the Nigerian government.
9
 
The revenue generated supports various government expenditures and contributes to 
the nation's fiscal stability. A significant portion of VAT revenue, 85%, is allocated to 
state and local governments, making it a vital component of subnational financing. 
The remaining 15% is retained by the Federal Government.
38
 The formula for VAT 
revenue allocation and the principle of derivation have been subjects of ongoing 
discussions and proposed reforms.
38 
The increase in the VAT rate to 7.5% in 2020 was a strategic move to boost non-oil 
revenue. The application of the destination principle ensures that VAT is levied where 
consumption occurs. The substantial allocation of VAT revenue to subnational 
governments highlights its role in supporting their financial autonomy. The continuing 
debates around the distribution formula underscore the complexities inherent in 
revenue sharing within a federal system.

Withholding Tax (WHT) 
Withholding Tax (WHT) in Nigeria is an advance payment of income tax, deducted at 
the source when certain payments are made to individuals or companies.
3
 The 
responsibility for withholding and remitting the tax lies with the payer. WHT is 
applicable to various types of income, including rents on properties, dividends and 
profits from companies, interest on bank deposits or securities, and royalties.
41
 It also 
covers transactions such as contracts for construction, surveys, and supply, 
consultancy and professional services, and management fees.
41 
The rates for withholding tax vary based on the nature of the payment and the status 
of the recipient, generally ranging from 2% to 10%.
9
 For instance, payments for rents, 
dividends, and interest typically attract a 10% WHT rate for both companies and 
individuals. Royalties are subject to 10% for companies and 5% for individuals, while 
fees for commission, consultancy, technical, and professional services are taxed at 
10% for companies and 5% for individuals.
9
 Recent amendments introduced by the 
Withholding Tax Regulations 2024, effective January 1, 2025, have adjusted some of 
these rates, including reductions for certain services and increases for non-resident 
entertainers, sportspersons, and directors' fees.
46 
The legal basis for Withholding Tax is found within the enabling laws of other tax 
types, such as the Companies Income Tax Act, Petroleum Profit Tax Act, Personal 
Income Tax Act, and Value Added Tax Act.
3
 The Deduction of Tax at Source 
(Withholding) Regulations 2024, which came into effect on January 1, 2025, 
consolidate and update the rules governing WHT, superseding previous regulations.
47 
Withholding Tax serves as a mechanism for the advance payment of income tax, 
aiming to broaden the tax base and reduce tax evasion by collecting tax at the point 
income is generated.
3
 The amounts withheld can then be used as a credit against the 
recipient's final income tax liability. WHT on payments to non-resident individuals, 
residents of the FCT, police and armed forces personnel, and foreign affairs officers is 
remitted to the FIRS. For other individuals, the tax is payable to the State Internal 
Revenue Service of their residence.
42
 Companies are required to file WHT returns 
within 21 days of the obligation to deduct arising, with penalties of 10% of the 
un-deducted or un-remitted amount for non-compliance.
43 

Withholding Tax is a vital tool for ensuring tax compliance and efficient collection. The 
varied rates based on income type and recipient status allow for a tailored approach. 
The recent regulatory overhaul reflects the government's commitment to modernizing 
the WHT system. The division of WHT revenue between the FIRS and state tax 
authorities highlights the collaborative nature of tax administration in Nigeria.

Tertiary Education Tax (TET) 
Tertiary Education Tax (TET) is levied on the assessable profit of all companies 
registered in Nigeria, with the exception of small companies having a gross turnover of 
NGN 25 million or less.
3
 The assessable profit is defined as the tax-adjusted profit 
before accounting for capital allowances.
3
 Non-resident companies and 
unincorporated entities are exempt from TET.
10 
The current rate of the Tertiary Education Tax is 3% of the assessable profit per 
annum, increased from 2.5% for accounting periods ending on or after September 1, 
2023.
10
 For companies subject to PPT under the PPTA, TET is considered an allowable 
deduction when calculating assessable profit. However, for other companies, income 
and profit taxes are not deductible for the purpose of TET, and this also applies to 
companies under the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.
10
 While the tax is officially payable 
within two months of receiving an assessment notice from the FIRS, many companies 

remit TET on a self-assessment basis concurrently with their Companies Income Tax.
10 
The Tertiary Education Tax is administered through the Tertiary Education Trust Fund 
(TETFund), which was established by the TETFund Act of 2011.
3
 The TETFund Act 
replaced the earlier Education Tax Act of 1993, tasking TETFund with the responsibility 
of imposing, managing, and disbursing the collected tax to public tertiary education 
institutions across Nigeria.
54
 The Finance Act 2023 brought about the increase in the 
TET rate.
55 
The primary purpose of the Tertiary Education Tax is to generate a dedicated funding 
stream for the development, maintenance, and improvement of tertiary education 
institutions in Nigeria.
52
 TETFund channels these funds to public universities, 
polytechnics, and colleges of education, with a distribution ratio of 2:1:1 respectively.
52
 
The funds are utilized for various critical needs, including the construction and 
renovation of infrastructure, procurement of instructional materials and equipment, 
support for research and publications, and the training and development of academic 
staff.
52 
The Tertiary Education Tax represents a targeted fiscal intervention aimed at 
addressing the persistent funding challenges within Nigeria's tertiary education 
sector. The recent increase in the tax rate underscores the government's ongoing 
commitment to enhancing the quality and accessibility of higher education. TETFund's 
role in the collection and distribution of these funds ensures a direct investment in the 
development of tertiary institutions nationwide. The specific tax treatment of TET for 
companies under the PPTA acknowledges the unique fiscal regime governing the 
petroleum sector. 
Capital Gains Tax (CGT) 
Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in Nigeria is imposed on the profits, or capital gains, realized 
from the disposal of certain assets, known as chargeable assets.
3
 Chargeable assets 
encompass a broad range of property, whether situated within or outside Nigeria, 
including land, buildings, stocks, foreign currencies, copyrights, bonds, and qualifying 
machinery.
11
 However, certain exemptions apply, such as gains from Nigerian 
government securities, treasury bonds, savings and premium bonds, life insurance 
policies, an individual's primary residence (under specific conditions), compensation 
for personal injury or professional wrong (up to a threshold), and decorations for 
valor.
3
 Since January 1, 2022, gains from the disposal of shares in Nigerian companies 
exceeding NGN100 million within a 12-month period are also subject to CGT, with 
exemptions for reinvestment within the same tax year.
69 

Capital Gains Tax is levied at a flat rate of 10% on the chargeable gain.
9
 The capital 
gain is calculated by subtracting the original cost of the asset and any expenses 
incurred on improvements or during the disposal process from the proceeds of the 
sale.
33
 Taxpayers who dispose of chargeable assets are required to compute the tax, 
file a self-assessment return, and make payment by June 30th and December 31st of 
the same year for disposals made in the respective halves of the year.
67 
The governing legislation for Capital Gains Tax is the Capital Gains Tax Act, Cap C1 
LFN 2004 (as amended).
3
 The Finance Acts of 2019, 2020, and 2021 have introduced 
amendments to this Act, particularly concerning the taxation of gains from the sale of 
shares and the stipulations for filing returns.
67 
Capital Gains Tax contributes to the Federal Government's revenue, taxing the profits 
generated from the disposal of specific assets.
9
 This revenue becomes part of the 
government's general fiscal resources, used to fund public services and contribute to 
economic development. The precise mechanism for allocating CGT revenue typically 
involves its deposit into the Federation Account. 
The Capital Gains Tax ensures that the government shares in the appreciation of asset 
values upon their disposal. The uniform rate of 10% simplifies the calculation and 
compliance. Amendments through the Finance Acts, especially regarding the taxation 
of shares, demonstrate the government's adaptation to financial market activities. 
Exemptions for certain assets aim to encourage investment and protect primary 
residences and specific compensations. 
National Information Technology Development Levy (NITDL) 
The National Information Technology Development Levy (NITDL) is imposed on 
specific companies operating in Nigeria with an annual turnover of NGN100 million or 
more.
3
 The levy is calculated as 1% of the company's profit before tax, as reported in 
their audited financial statements.
79
 Companies liable for NITDL include those in the 
telecommunications sector (GSM service providers and all telecommunication 
companies), cyber companies and internet providers, pension managers and related 
companies, banks and other financial institutions, and insurance companies.
3
 Foreign 
companies meeting the turnover threshold and operating within these sectors in 
Nigeria are also subject to the levy.
78 
The applicable rate for NITDL is 1% of the profit before tax of the liable companies.
4
 
Notably, the levy paid is tax-deductible for the purposes of the company's income 
tax.
3
 The NITDL is due within 60 days of the company receiving an assessment notice 
from the FIRS or within six months following the end of the company's accounting 

year, coinciding with the filing of CIT returns.
78
 Failure to remit the levy within the 
specified period attracts a penalty of 2% of the unpaid amount.
78 
The NITDL is imposed and governed by the National Information Technology 
Development Agency (NITDA) Act 2007.
3
 The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is 
the agency responsible for the administration of the NITDL, including its assessment 
and collection.
78 
The revenue generated from the NITDL is specifically earmarked to support the 
planning, development, and promotion of information technology within Nigeria.
3
 
These funds are managed by the National Information Technology Development Fund 
(NITDF).
79
 The NITDF's objectives include establishing a framework for IT 
development, providing guidelines for IT application across various sectors, enhancing 
internet penetration, and promoting effective internet governance.
79 
The NITDL is a targeted levy aimed at key sectors of the Nigerian economy that are 
significant consumers and drivers of information technology and financial services. 
The turnover threshold ensures that the levy primarily applies to larger entities within 
these sectors. The tax-deductible nature of the levy helps to mitigate its impact on 
the profitability of these companies while still contributing to the advancement of 
Nigeria's IT infrastructure. Recent data suggests a notable increase in contributions to 
the NITDEF, indicating improved compliance or more rigorous enforcement.
81 
Recent Changes and Updates Related to FIRS-Administered 
Taxes 
The Nigerian tax landscape, particularly concerning taxes administered by the FIRS, 
has witnessed several recent changes and proposed updates, reflecting the 
government's ongoing efforts to modernize the system and enhance revenue 
collection.
51 
The Tertiary Education Tax (TET) rate was increased from 2.5% to 3% for 
accounting periods ending on or after September 1, 2023.
55
 This adjustment aims to 
provide more resources for the development of Nigeria's tertiary education sector. 
Significant changes have occurred in Withholding Tax (WHT) with the introduction 
of the Deduction of Tax at Source (Withholding) Regulations 2024, effective January 1, 
2025.
47
 These new regulations repeal all previous WHT regulations and include revised 
rates for various services, as well as exemptions for small businesses under specific 
conditions.
46 

While the standard Value Added Tax (VAT) rate remains at 7.5% 
51
, there have been 
considerable discussions and proposed reforms regarding the formula for sharing VAT 
revenue among the federal, state, and local governments.
38
 Additionally, the VAT 
Exemption List has been expanded and amended, particularly to support the 
government's energy transition initiatives, especially concerning gas.
51 
Regarding Capital Gains Tax (CGT), a key update was the introduction of a 10% tax 
on gains from the disposal of shares in Nigerian companies exceeding NGN100 million 
within a 12-month period, effective January 1, 2022. This change was brought about 
by an amendment to Section 30 of the Capital Gains Tax Act through the Finance Act 
2021.
59 
A comprehensive Nigeria Tax Bill 2024 has been proposed by the Presidential 
Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms, aiming to overhaul the entire tax 
system.
90
 The bill suggests a gradual reduction in the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate, 
a phased increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate, reforms to the Personal Income 
Tax (PIT) structure, and the introduction of a new Development Levy that would 
consolidate several existing levies. 
In February 2024, the government introduced the Expatriate Employment Levy 
(EEL), a mandatory contribution for employers who hire expatriate staff in Nigeria.
51
 
Furthermore, a windfall tax on the foreign exchange gains of Nigerian banks, 
resulting from the devaluation of the Naira, was proposed in 2024.
51
 To incentivize 
investment in the gas sector, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu signed the Gas 
Incentives Order 2024 in March 2024, outlining specific incentives for 
Non-Associated Gas (NAG) development.
51 
The FIRS has also been active in issuing various guidelines and circulars to provide 
clarity and updates on tax administration. These include guidelines on VAT compliance 
for non-resident digital service providers (October 2021), procedures for desk 
examination, tax audit, investigation, and inquiry (October 2023), and the process for 
Value Added Tax refunds for diplomats and international organizations (2024).
51 
These recent changes and proposed reforms indicate a dynamic tax environment in 
Nigeria, with the government actively seeking to modernize its tax system, improve 
revenue generation, and adapt to evolving economic conditions. Taxpayers need to 
remain vigilant about these developments to ensure they meet their compliance 
obligations. 
Obtaining a Tax Identification Number (TIN) from the FIRS 

Obtaining a Tax Identification Number (TIN) is a crucial step for both individuals and 
businesses operating in Nigeria, as it is required for various tax-related and official 
transactions.
97
 The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has established processes 
for TIN registration, catering to different categories of taxpayers.
4 
For Individuals: 
Individuals have several options for registering and obtaining a TIN 
99
: 
● 
Online Registration: The most convenient method is through the Joint Tax Board 
(JTB) TIN registration portal (https://tin.jtb.gov.ng/).
99
 This typically involves 
completing an online form, which may require linking your Bank Verification 
Number (BVN) or National Identification Number (NIN).
99
 You might also need to 
upload supporting documents such as a valid identification (National ID, Driver's 
License, or Passport) and a recent utility bill.

For Businesses and Organizations: 
Businesses and organizations can also register for a TIN through online or in-person 
methods 
4
: 
● 
Online Registration: Non-individual entities can register via the JTB portal or the 
FIRS TaxPro Max portal (https://taxpromax.firs.gov.ng).
4
 This requires providing 
detailed business information, such as the company name, registration number 
obtained from the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), and the business 
address.

accounts, applying for government loans and trade licenses, and obtaining Tax 

Clearance Certificates (TCCs).
97

the FIRS and JTB, registrations done on the JTB website might need to be validated at 
the nearest FIRS office for full activation.

Role and Functions of the FIRS in Tax Administration and 
Enforcement 
The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is the central authority responsible for the 
administration and enforcement of federal tax laws in Nigeria.
3
 Its core mandate 
includes the assessment, collection, and accounting for all revenues accruing to the 
Federal Government of Nigeria.
3
 The FIRS's functions are broad and encompass the 
entire tax administration lifecycle 
3
: 
● 
Assessment: The FIRS is responsible for determining the tax liability of 
individuals, companies, and other taxable entities.
3
 This involves reviewing tax 
returns, conducting audits, and ensuring accurate reporting of income and 
profits. 
● 
Collection: A primary function of the FIRS is to collect taxes due to the Federal 
Government.
3
 The agency employs various methods to facilitate tax payment, 
including online platforms and designated bank branches. 
● 
Accounting: The FIRS is tasked with the responsibility of accounting for all taxes 
collected, ensuring that these revenues are properly recorded and remitted to the 
designated government accounts, such as the Federation Account, Consolidated 
Account, and VAT Account.
3 
● 
Enforcement: The FIRS is empowered to enforce compliance with tax laws.
3
 This 
includes conducting investigations into tax evasion and fraud, imposing penalties 
for non-compliance, and, in collaboration with law enforcement agencies, 
prosecuting tax offenders. 
● 
Taxpayer Services: The FIRS also plays a crucial role in providing services to 
taxpayers.
3
 This includes issuing Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs), 
providing tax education and information through various channels, issuing tax 
rulings and clarifications, and processing tax refunds. 
● 
Policy and Collaboration: The FIRS collaborates with relevant government 
ministries and agencies to review tax policies and promote the use of tax 
revenues to stimulate economic activities and development.
104
 The agency also 
works to determine the extent of financial losses to the government resulting from 
tax fraud, evasion, and waivers.
104 
To enhance its operations, the FIRS has been actively involved in organizational 
restructuring and the implementation of technological solutions, such as the TaxPro 

Max platform, to streamline tax processes and improve service delivery.
92
 The 
agency's organizational structure includes a Management Board that provides policy 
guidelines and oversees the administration of the revenue assessment, collection, and 
accounting systems.
105
 The FIRS is committed to becoming a more efficient and 
trusted revenue service, focusing on taxpayer convenience and maximizing revenue 
for national development.
104 
Official Resources and Guides Provided by the FIRS 
The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) offers a wide array of official resources and 
guides to assist taxpayers in understanding and complying with Nigeria's federal tax 
laws.
26
 The primary hub for this information is the FIRS website (www.firs.gov.ng).
4
 
This platform provides access to: 
● 
Comprehensive Tax Information: Detailed explanations of various tax types 
administered by the FIRS, including their tax bases, applicable rates, and the 
relevant legislation governing them. 
● 
Downloadable Tax Forms and Instructions: A wide range of tax forms for 
different tax obligations, along with detailed instructions to guide taxpayers on 
how to accurately complete and submit these forms.

contain the latest pronouncements, updates, and clarifications on tax laws, 
administrative practices, and policy changes issued by the FIRS.

acts and related legislation in Nigeria.

In addition to the website, the FIRS has implemented the TaxPro Max System 
(https://taxpromax.firs.gov.ng), an electronic platform designed to facilitate various 
tax-related processes online. This includes TIN registration, filing of tax returns, 
making tax payments, and obtaining Tax Clearance Certificates (TCCs).
93
 Individuals 

and non-individual entities can also utilize the Joint Tax Board (JTB) TIN 
Registration Portal (https://tin.jtb.gov.ng/) for obtaining their Tax Identification 
Numbers.
4 
For a historical perspective on tax reforms, the FIRS Handbook on Reforms in the 
Tax System 2004-2011 offers valuable insights into the evolution of Nigeria's tax 
system.
113
 Furthermore, the FIRS has introduced a convenient USSD Code (*829#), 
allowing taxpayers to access basic tax services such as TIN retrieval, TCC verification, 
tax rates inquiry, and location of the nearest tax office via their mobile phones.
109
 To 
further support taxpayers, the FIRS has established a Taxpayer Service Department 
and the position of a National Taxpayer Advocate to address concerns and provide 
assistance.
105 
These official resources demonstrate the FIRS's commitment to providing taxpayers 
with the necessary tools and information to navigate the Nigerian federal tax system 
effectively and ensure compliance. Taxpayers are encouraged to utilize these 
resources to stay informed and meet their tax obligations. 
Conclusion 
The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) plays a pivotal role in Nigeria's fiscal 
management by administering a wide range of federal taxes that are critical for 
funding national development. This report has provided a detailed overview of the 
major taxes under the FIRS's jurisdiction, including their tax bases, rates, legislative 
frameworks, and revenue allocation. The recent changes and ongoing reforms within 
the Nigerian tax system highlight the government's commitment to modernization and 
efficiency. The streamlined processes for obtaining a Tax Identification Number (TIN) 
and the comprehensive resources offered by the FIRS aim to enhance taxpayer 
compliance and facilitate a more robust revenue generation framework. As Nigeria 
continues to evolve economically, the effective administration of these taxes by the 
FIRS will remain central to achieving sustainable growth and development.
